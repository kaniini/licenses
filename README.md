# Licenses for freeware and open-source software releases

These licenses should be suitable for software releases in Oklahoma, consistent with all
legal requirements.

There are presently 3 licenses included:

* `COPYING.Non-Copyleft-Attribution-Required`: A simple non-copyleft license which is a
  variant of the ISC license with non-applicable liability text removed.  The feature of
  this license over ISC is that whatever liabilities may be removed under law are removed
  without risking making the license void by revoking liabilities that you are not legally
  entitled to revoke.

* `COPYING.Reciprocal-Copyleft-Attribution-Required`: A simple copyleft license which is
  a variant of the modified ISC license mentioned above.  Works by requiring that sources
  are included with or made available to those who receive a distribution of the software.

* `COPYING.Binary-Only-No-Special-Rights`: A simple binary-only license which is a variant
  of the first license mentioned above.  Allows for use and redistribution of the binary
  distribution.  This sort of license would be suitable for "freeware" releases.

## Disclaimer

These licenses are offered as templates of license terms I am presently using, but should
not be interpreted as formal legal advice.  Use these templates accordingly.
